# You should write a program that takes input as follows:
# The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m (0 < n,m <= 100) which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field respectively. The next n lines contains exactly m characters and represent the field. Each safe square is represented by an "." character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented by an "*" character (also without the quotes). The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.
